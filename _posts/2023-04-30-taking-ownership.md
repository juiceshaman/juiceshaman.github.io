I want to rid myself of the shackles imposed by social media companies. I from now on want to live on my own real estate on the internet.
The other option would be to continue letting facebook mediate my entire interaction with people and ideas over the internet.
Instead, I created this website so that I can have an outlet for ideas that is mine.

Digital Independence is something I recently have been thinking a lot about. There is just no way to be "independent" when one uses the common services provided by the big tech companies.
The same goes for hardware and their operating systems. Which is why as soon as my current cell phone might "break" I will not hurry to get me a new one. I am excited to try living for a whilewithout this constant availability of all the worlds information few clicks away.

I want to regain trust in my own mental faculties, especially my memory, that might be a better help to some of my questions and problems that arise during the day, than google could ever be. The problem with google answering my questions is that I rarely experience much significance in whatever information/insight I might gain, and so as fast as the answer came up, it is already forgotten. This is different for hard earned answers, following thinking and directed attention.

I am lucky in that I don't have a big problem with standing boredom. But for many people and I could see myself easily falling into that pit again, even fractions of a minute of non-stimulation on the train, the bus or even sitting with people and having nothing to talk about, is enough to have to grab the phone and re-enter this pseudo social sphere that is so rewarding to our limbic system.
I hope that many more people will in the future go and create their own platforms on the internet as a slower, more personal and (maybe) more real way of utilizing this interconnectedness.
I would much enjoy reading essays or journal entries and reports on whatever creative endeavours peope might be on; much more than I enjoy the currently available aesthetics provided by the fast-pace social media feeds and the algorithm curated visibility thereof.
