Ever noticed, how different thoughts arise during the day? Varying depending on context of inner and outer reality. One striking example of this is how when one wakes up and stays in bed, there seem to not come any "good" thoughts to mind. Conversely, getting up out of bed and starting your day jump starts the fabrication of ideas (e.g. commitments made, wishes for the future, possibilites and events). I am close to believing that no good thoughts can arise from staying in bed when awake and for me this might be the single most effective factor for a more thoughtful and aware relationship to this existence.
